HOW TO PREPARE

1) Review/Redo all of Test First from scratch.

    TestFirst Part 1
    TestFirst Part 2
    TestFirst Review
        Do not use your solutions unless you are completely stuck.


2) Review/Redo Checkpoints 1 and 2 from scratch.

CONCEPTS TO FOCUS ON:

    * Higher Order Functions (TestFirst: 05,06)
        Passing functions as values to other functions
    
    * Closure (TestFirst: 05)
        Review the Once, Three(from the checkpoint), and the sometimes function from the new problem set.

    * Objects
        What is the difference between an internal prototype and the .prototype property on function objects?
        How does the new keyword work?
        What is Object.create? How can it be used?
        Know how to set up an inheritance chain where multiple objects link to one another
        Know how to place properties and methods on the .prototype object of a class and constructor function
        Review 08_Classes - Know how to use Class syntax (you don't need to memorize it, 
                    remember you can reference documentation on the checkpoint, 
                    you can't reference practice problems or notes).

    * Loops
        Know how to loop over an object with a for/in loop
        Have a clear understanding on how nested loops work
        Object.hasOwnProperty - What is the function used for?
        Object.keys - What is the return value? How would you use it?

    * Functional Programming:
        Review the implemention of reduce you created in TestFirst.
        Understand how the following native JS Functions work(you created variations of these in 06_Functional-Programming):
            Array.prototype.map
            Array.prototype.filter
            Array.prototype.reduce
            Array.prototype.forEach
    
    * 'this'
        Feel comfortable using the this keyword.
        Have an understanding of how the context of this can change
            It can change when:
            A function is called with the new keyword.
            A function is called with .call or .apply (know how to use these functions)
            The call-site of the function (is the function using this called on an object or the global scope)
